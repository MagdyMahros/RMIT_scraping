 We live in a data-driven world that’s generating huge volumes of information at ever-increasing rates via social media, financial transactions, transportation, and even scientific discovery. As a consequence, an understanding of data is a top priority for all of us – whether you’re in business, industry and government, or individually as citizens and consumers.
 The new interdisciplinary field of data science combines areas of computer science with mathematical statistics and domain expertise to manage and analyse data. Specialists develop the capability to derive insight and opportunity from the vast repositories of information that organisations collect. Data science also puts a greater emphasis on the specialised computational skills required to manage and analyse big data from sources such as social media, massive sensors, mobile and transaction data. It enables businesses to gain a competitive edge, governments to deliver more targeted services, and research teams make new discoveries. Data science and its analysis could appeal to people from a broad range of backgrounds, such as graduates from computing, mathematics, science, engineering or health. Through this degree, you'll build mix of skills in analytics, statistics and computer science that will enable you to be central to business decision-making, corporate strategy and government planning.
